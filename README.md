# ODINBOT
This is the code behind our beloved odin-bot

This code was originally _heavily_ inspired by the [giphy-gitter](https://github.com/dervondenbergen/giphy-gitter) bot by [dervondenbergen](https://github.com/dervondenbergen) (i.e. I stole all his code and started hacking on it)

At this point, the structure of the code has morphed a bit, though the core implementation of both the giphy and gitter APIs have stayed about the same.

## Contributing
I welcome any contributions.. but I don't want our Bot to become too obnoxious, so I have to be quite judicious about what features actually get implemented.
I may implement a funny phrase or something for a short amount of time, but turn it off eventually once the joke has been played out.. that's just the nature of the thing.

If you want to chat about it, I usually hang out in the [Odin Project Gitter](https://gitter.im/TheOdinProject/)
